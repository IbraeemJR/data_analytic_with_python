# Problem Statement:
## Context:

A small company manufactures a specific type of electronic component. Historically, the defect rate for these components is 6% (or 0.06). The quality control department wants to assess the likelihood of encountering a certain number of defective components in a batch.

## Problem:

The company tests a batch of 20 components. They want to determine the probability that at most 2 of these components are defective.
