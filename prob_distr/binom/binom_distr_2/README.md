# Problem Statement:
## Context:

A software company is testing a new feature that it plans to roll out to a sample group of users. The company expects that about 40% (or 0.4) of the users in such tests will find the new feature useful and provide positive feedback.

## Problem:

The company selects a random sample of 20 users to test the new feature. The team wants to calculate the probability that exactly 10 out of these 20 users will find the new feature useful and provide positive feedback.

## Question:

What is the probability that exactly 10 out of the 20 sampled users will find the new feature useful?
