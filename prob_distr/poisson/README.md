# Poisson Distribution Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the Poisson distribution, a probability distribution used to model the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space. The Poisson distribution is particularly useful in scenarios where events occur independently and at a constant average rate.

## Poisson Distribution Formula

The probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:

\[ P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \]

where:
- \( X \) is the number of events in the interval.
- \( k \) is the actual number of events that occur.
- \( \lambda \) is the average rate of events (mean of the distribution).
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828).

## Real-Life Applications

The Poisson distribution is commonly used in various fields to model the number of occurrences of an event over a specified interval. Some real-life examples include:
- **Call centers**: Modeling the number of incoming calls per hour.
- **Traffic flow**: Estimating the number of cars passing through a toll booth in an hour.
- **Biology**: Counting the number of mutations in a given stretch of DNA.
- **Astronomy**: Counting the number of stars in a particular region of the sky.

## Project Components

1. **Python Implementation**: This project includes a Python script (`poisson_distribution.py`) that calculates probabilities using the Poisson distribution. It also includes functions to generate Poisson-distributed random variables and visualize the distribution.

2. **Data Analysis**: A Jupyter notebook (`poisson_analysis.ipynb`) demonstrating real-life examples and applications of the Poisson distribution. The notebook contains code to analyze and visualize data using the Poisson distribution.

3. **Documentation**: This README file provides an overview of the project, its applications, and instructions for running the code.
