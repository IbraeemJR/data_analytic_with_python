# README: Uniform Distribution of Assembly Time


## Description

This document describes the uniform distribution of assembly times for a plastic module and provides a solution to find the probability that a given assembly time falls within a specified range.


## Problem Description
The time it takes to assemble a plastic module is uniformly distributed between 27 and 39 seconds.

Uniform Distribution: The assembly time T is modeled as a uniform distribution:

Tâˆ¼U(27,39)

This means that every time within the interval [27,39] seconds is equally likely.


## Objective

Calculate the probability that a given assembly will take between 30 and 35 seconds.
